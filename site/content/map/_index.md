---



Use these **live viewers** to see nodes and packets in near real-time. During meetups we post event channels in Discord so everyone can follow along.

## Live Viewers
- **Meshtastic Explorer** — powerful filters, device/packet views: <https://explorer.meshtastic.org>
- **Meshview** — lightweight global viewer: <https://meshview.org>
- **Liam Cottle Map** — simple, fast map: <https://meshtastic.liamcottle.net>

> Tip: If you don't want your position shown publicly, disable position beacons, or use a private channel with unique PSK.

## Mapping Quick Start
1. **Telemetry interval:** start with **2–5 minutes** for mapping; go shorter (60–90s) only when the mesh isn’t busy.  
2. **Change one variable at a time:** antenna, height, or location.  
3. **Note your test points:** add short notes in messages (e.g., “Test A @ park bench”).  
4. **Elevation & LOS:** higher placement and clear line-of-sight often matter more than transmit power.

See also: **[Docs → Map & Data (Overview)](/docs/map-data/)** for testing etiquette and data we track.

## El Paso specifics
- Terrain and buildings create **shadowed blocks**; try small elevation changes (hills, rooftops, parking structures).  
- A modest **mast/tripod** and a tuned **915 MHz antenna** can dramatically improve results.  
- For fixed relays, stable power and safe, **elevated placement** help the whole community.

## Contribute Data
- Share screenshots or exported tracks in the Discord **#meetups** thread after events.  
- Post approximate relay locations (general area/elevation is enough) so others can plan paths.  
- Bring your node to the **[Weekly Net](/docs/weekly-net/)** for structured range loops.

## Troubleshooting (map visibility)
- **No dot on the map?** Ensure telemetry is enabled and your **Region = US-915**.  
- **Still missing?** You might be on a **private channel** (by design). Switch to a public/demo channel during tests.  
- **Garbled location or jumps?** Give the GPS more sky view or lengthen intervals.
