Our **Weekly Net** is a casual, field‑friendly meetup focused on **onboarding, range testing, and hands‑on learning**.

{{< alert color="info" >}}
**Schedule:** **TBD**  
**Location:** announced in **#meeting-plans** on Discord (may rotate for coverage testing)  
**RSVP:** [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/elp-mesh) and watch the event thread
{{< /alert >}}

## What to bring
- **Your node** (charged) + spare power bank / cable
- **Phone with Meshtastic app** installed and paired
- **915 MHz antenna** (and any antennas you want to compare)
- Optional: small tripod/mast, tape measure, notebook, water/sun protection

## Channel plan (events)
For meetups we use a **temporary event channel** (shared in the Discord event thread).  
This keeps public/demo traffic separate from day‑to‑day channels.

- Look for a pinned message with the **channel QR** or **import string**
- After the event, switch back to your usual channel

## Net flow (typical)
1. **Kickoff & roll call** — quick check‑ins, help newcomers flash/pair/set **US‑915**
2. **Antenna & placement tips** — height, LOS, coax basics
3. **Range test loop** — walk/drive tests; compare antenna/placement changes
4. **Data review** — maps/logs, what worked, gaps to target next time
5. **Announcements** — upcoming build nights, relay spots, hardware swaps

## Range test recipe (simple)
- Set **Position/Telemetry** interval to ~2–5 min for mapping; shorter (e.g., 60–90s) if the mesh isn’t congested
- Use **consistent test messages** (e.g., “Test A @ park bench”, “Test B @ overlook”)
- Change **one variable at a time** (antenna, height, location) and note results
- Share **RSSI/SNR** snippets in the event thread so we can compare later

## Etiquette
- Keep messages short; avoid flooding the mesh
- Identify your test messages (add initials)
- Help newcomers first; advanced tweaks later in the session
- Be mindful of heat/terrain and private property

## Troubleshooting corner
- **No traffic seen?** Verify **US‑915**, event channel, and app pairing
- **Spotty range?** Raise the antenna; try a different location or orientation
- **Odd reboots?** Swap USB cable/power; check battery seating

## After the net
- Switch back to your normal channel
- Post any maps/screen caps in the recap thread
- Vote on the next test area so we can expand coverage methodically
